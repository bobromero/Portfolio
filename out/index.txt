",["$","br",null,{}]," ",["$","br",null,{}],"My initial interest in learning about computers started when I found out about video game mods. When I was young computers and software seemed mysterious, and something which I only interacted with. Video games like Minecraft seemed no different until I found out about software that could be downloaded to make my favorite game even better. This software was not created by a mysterious all-powerful developer, but by a member of the game’s community, someone like me.

This sparked my interest in game development, as it naturally was a project idea that interested me. I tried diving headfirst into game development on my own with unity and C#, but with no experience before this, it was extremely hard to follow what was going on. I was not deterred, and I decided to take a step back and focus on the basics, html, CSS, and JavaScript. These were the languages taught in my first class, and after being introduced to react, I was able to create my first full game. This taught me that with enough time, patience, and effort, I could develop anything. The momentum did not stop there, and before I knew it, I was heading to college.

I started with heading back to my roots and looking into game mods development. A game called Valheim released that was notable because of its indie developers. It was made by a small studio and blew up in popularity. The game was made in Unity, which is known for being easy to mod, and subsequently received plenty of mods from the community. I had the idea to try game development in C# again and decided that I was going to make a mod no matter how difficult it was or what I had to do. It was an arduous process, but after a couple of weeks of scouring the internet and asking questions, I learned how to make my very own Valheim mod.

I created a discord server and instruction set to help others develop their own games, doing what I could to point those trying to learn in the right direction. After doing this and creating my own mods for the game, the developers recognized my efforts and offered me a position at the company. I had come full circle, starting out my journey as a young kid trying to download mods for my favorite game, to being the developer of one of my favorite games. I continue to learn and develop interesting ideas pushing myself because I know from experience that putting in effort consistently yields results."]}]]}]}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"education-skills-grid","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"summary-box","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"info-card","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"info-card-title","children":"Education"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"info-card-description","children":"$undefined"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"info-card-content","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"education-div","children":[["$","h4",null,{"className":"subsection-title","children":"Florida State University"}],["$","br",null,{}],["$","div",null,{"className":"center","children":["$","img",null,{"className":"education-image","src":"https://github.com/bobromero/Portfolio/blob/main/public/fsu.png?raw=true","alt":"fsu logo"}]}],["$","br",null,{}],["$","p",null,{"className":"main-page-font text-center","children":"January 2022 - December 2025"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"main-page-font text-center","children":"Bachelor of Computer Science B.A. "}]]}],["$","br",null,{}],["$","div",null,{"className":"education-div ","children":[["$","h4",null,{"className":"subsection-title","children":"Christopher Columbus High School"}],["$","br",null,{}],["$","div",null,{"className":"center","children":["$","img",null,{"className":"education-image","src":"https://github.com/bobromero/Portfolio/blob/main/public/columbus.jpg?raw=true","alt":"CCHS logo"}]}],["$","br",null,{}],["$","p",null,{"className":"main-page-font text-center","children":"August 2017 - June 2021"}]]}],["$","br",null,{}],["$","div",null,{"className":"education-div","children":[["$","h4",null,{"className":"subsection-title","children":"Eagle Scout"}],["$","br",null,{}],["$","div",null,{"className":"center","children":["$","img",null,{"className":"education-image","src":"https://github.com/bobromero/Portfolio/blob/main/public/bsa.png?raw=true","alt":"BSA logo"}]}],["$","br",null,{}],["$","p",null,{"className":"main-page-font text-center","children":"August 2010 - December 2020"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"main-page-font text-center","children":"Troop 816"}],["$","br",null,{}]]}]]}]]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"summary-box","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"info-card","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"info-card-title","children":"Skills"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"info-card-description","children":"$undefined"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"info-card-content","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h4",null,{"className":"subsection-title","children":"Web Dev(Html, Css, Javascript)"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"main-page-font","children":["I started developing with ",["$","strong",null,{"children":"HTML"}],", ",["$","strong",null,{"children":"CSS"}],", and ",["$","strong",null,{"children":"JavaScript"}]," and fell in love after using ",["$","strong",null,{"children":"React"}]," and ",["$","strong",null,{"children":"NodeJS"}],"."]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h4",null,{"className":"subsection-title","children":"C# and .Net"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"main-page-font","children":["I have spent a whole lot of time in Visual Studio working with ",["$","strong",null,{"children":".Net"}],".Net and ",["$","strong",null,{"children":"C#"}],", developing everything from video games to management services."]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h4",null,{"className":"subsection-title","children":"Game Dev(Unity, Godot)"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"main-page-font","children":["I have spent a lot of time developing ",["$","strong",null,{"children":"video games"}]," and ",["$","strong",null,{"children":"mods"}]," and find it enjoyable to do in my spare time."]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h4",null,{"className":"subsection-title","children":"Databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"main-page-font","children":"Data is the most important part of any tech business, and being proficient in the leading technologies is required."}]]}]]}]}]]}]}]]}]]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"summary-box","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"info-card-title","children":"Cool Projects"}],["$","h2",null,{"className":"info-card-description","children":"List of all projects on the projects tab."}],[["$","div","Kingslayer",{"className":"","children":["$","a",null,{"href":"https://github.com/bobromero/CEN-4090L-PROJ","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"card-title","children":"Kingslayer"}],["$","br",null,{}],["$","p",null,{"className":"card-description main-page-font","children":"Kingslayer is a video game made in Godot with a mix of gdscript and C#.
