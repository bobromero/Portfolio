                    My group and I are making a clicker game for our project. We met via facetime and decided on a retake on a classic. You shake your phone and a ball bounces around the screen. The more it bounces, the more points you get and the more you can progress.

                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>

                    We have BIG IDEAS for this project and have high expectations for it. My group members are great and I look forward to working with them.

                    <br></br>


                    We already have a working prototype with a ball that bounces and speeds up when shaking! Very exciting!
