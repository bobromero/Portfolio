                    Hello, my name is Robert and I like philosophy, golf and computers.
                    On my free time, you can find me at the local golf courses, or studying in the library(Proud Diracian). I am a pretty normal College student, but I do some other more unique stuff too haha.

                    I keep the ghosts of tallahassee contained as seen in this picture.
                    I am the ghostbuster of tally and have irrefutable proof of such.
                    Most people think ghost aren't real, but I assure you that they are, and that they are watching you RIGHT NOW!
                    Don't worry thogh, they are mostly harmless.
                    If you encounter a ghost acting up, make sure to not listen to what it says, and give me a call.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Golfing is my favorite pass time, and even though I am not the greatest I still enjoy the process of getting better.
                    Patience is a virtue and sometimes I don't have enough of it, but who does!
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    But yeah, thats it for me. Signing off, and always remember, the ghost are watching. :)
